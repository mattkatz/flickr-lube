Flickr-Lube
===========

What is it?
-----------
Flickr-Lube is a simple ruby script designed to make it easier to [FuckFlickr][fflickr]. If you already have a bunch of photos up on flickr, this will pull down those photos, put them in the appropriate sets, and make sure they have the right descriptions and titles.


How do I use it?
----------------

Flickr-Lube is [ruby][rb], so you need to have ruby installed for whatever platform you are on. In addition, it uses [ruby gems][gems] and the [fleakr gem][fleakr].

If you already have ruby and rubygems installed, you can just `gem install fleakr` or `sudo gem install fleakr`.  

Edit this script to put in your flickr username and you should be ready to run it.
